--- label, the ground truth segmentation results for each pile of instrument generated by LabelMe. Blue is scalpel, bright green is hemostat, red is scissors, brown is babcock forceps, dark green is retractor, black is background.
--- mask, the mask of mayo stand generated using Otsu's algorithm

For example, for the first taken image, it has four files named:
color_1,
depth_1,
label_1,
mask_1,

================
Folder image_rotated contains the rotated versions of all images from image_original folder. Each image is rotated in 8 directions, thus resulting in 480 images. Each image has 4 corresponding images, therefore there are in total 480*4=1920 files in this folder.

================
Folder annotations contains the output of the LabelME tool in ground truth segmentation. For details on interpreting this file, please refer to LabelMe website.
